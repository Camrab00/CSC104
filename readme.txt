Project Description

The Gaming Universe Hub is a website created to showcase my favorite video games and provide visitors with game information, reviews, and entertainment news. It highlights three popular titles — Hades 2, Battlefield 6, and Terraria — and presents them in a modern, visually appealing layout.

The website demonstrates core web design principles including:

HTML5 structure and semantic tags

CSS3 styling with color, typography, and layout control

A user-friendly interface with easy navigation

Responsive design elements that display cleanly on various screen sizes

Files and Folders

HTML Files:

index.html – The homepage introducing the Gaming Universe Hub, including a hero section and featured games.

games.html – A detailed page highlighting information about the top featured games.

contact.html – Contains a contact form where users can send feedback or suggest new games.

CSS Files:

css/style.css – Contains all styles used across the website, including layout, fonts, color schemes, and form design.

Image Folder:

/images/ – Includes game cover images used for the featured game cards:

hades2.jpg

battlefield6.jpg

terraria.jpg

Website Functionality / Output Description

The homepage displays a navigation bar, a welcome banner, and three featured game cards.
Each game card includes an image, title, and short description.
The "Top Games" page expands on these with additional details, and the "Contact" page includes a simple form styled with CSS.

The layout is consistent throughout the site, with a dark gaming-inspired color palette, readable text, and hover effects for user interactivity.

Validation

All HTML and CSS files were validated using:

https://validator.w3.org

https://html5.validator.nu

No major validation errors were found. Minor warnings (if any) were reviewed and corrected.

User Interface Notes

The interface is designed to be clear, organized, and visually balanced.

All text is easy to read, and all navigation links work properly.

The layout and content are self-explanatory for first-time visitors.
